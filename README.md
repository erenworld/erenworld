# About me


Born in France, Central Asian roots. Heart of the Middle East. Balkan habits. Mediterranean spirit.
I speak English, French, Turkish, and Bulgarian.
I read a lot.
I lift weights.
I chase knowledge, embrace discipline, and live for the challenge.
Curious about the world and constantly learning from it.
I believe in balance: work, strength, creativity, and rest.
I explore new ideas, cultures, and opportunities wherever they may arise.
In everything I do, I aim to grow.

"Play long-term games with long-term people."
