## Hi there, I'm Eren 👋

I'm a performance engineer, focusing on making the web faster. Like my work? [Consider hiring me.](https://erenkad.com/)

Previously, I was the first engineer at [Kolizeo](https://kolizeo.vercel.app), helping to deliver a Linktree-style platform for some of the biggest clubs in France, used by tens of thousands of spectators. :gear:

You can find my website over [here](https://erenkad.com) and I'm active on [X](https://x.com/erentrkg) :star2:

I am generally pretty responsive to issues, pull requests and comments. If you feel like I've missed something, tag my GitHub account into a comment.
