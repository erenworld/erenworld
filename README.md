### Hi, I'm Eren

I'm a database enthusiast focused on making queries faster. Like my work? [Consider hiring me.](https://erenkad.com/)
Right now, I’m learning everything I can about SQLite and contributing to [TursoDB](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso/), the next-generation SQLite built in Rust.

Previously, I was the first software engineer at [Kolizeo](https://kolizeo.vercel.app/sluc), where I helped build and ship a Linktree-style platform used by thousands of users.

You can find my website [here](https://erenkad.com), and I share my work on [X](https://x.com/erentrkg).

Commits and tags are signed with my SSH key fingerprint: `sS4V0G6hZMY4wzPIppaC8wXgGxtqZdzxJYrbSMOfEWE`. NPM packages are published under [`erenturkoglu`](https://www.npmjs.com/~erenturkoglu).

I try to stay responsive to issues, pull requests, and comments. If I’ve missed something, feel free to tag me in a comment.
